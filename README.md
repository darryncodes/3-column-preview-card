## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SASS
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   BEM methodology

### What I learned

-   Continued practice with use of inline SVGs
-   I challenged myself to estimate how long the build would take and tried my best to stick to it
-   I also have put a lot of emphasis on design thinking, not rushing into a solution, planning it out, staying calmn and not loosing my head when things do not seem to work

### Continued development

-   Continue to embed real-world best practices like responsive design, readable code, comments and use don't repeat yourself principles
-   Consider mobile first approach
